ServiceNow Configuration
The best way for the initial configuration of the ServiceNow is to use the “ITSM guided setup” application. 
Generally, only system administrators have access to ITSM guided setup application.

SLAs Configuration
SLA stands for Service Level Agreement, which is a commitment or contract between the service provider and the service consumer (customer), 
or it can also be commitment between various departments within an organisation. This contract clearly states the level of service that, 
the provider should give, the response time, the resolution time of incidents, penalties (if any), uptime, system performance, etc.

Workflows
The ServiceNow defines workflow as sequence of activities to automate processes in applications. 
It is basically a flowchart, which records all the activities to be triggered step by step, once the desired event has occurred.
